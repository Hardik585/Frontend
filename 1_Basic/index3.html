        <h3>Difference btw src and href </h3>
        <strong> Purpose:</strong> The src attribute is used to embed a resource in a document, such as an image, video,
        or script.
        <p></p>
        <strong>Usage: </strong>It loads and includes the external resource directly within the page, like embedding an
        image or
        JavaScript file.
        <h4></h4>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> The href attribute is used to reference a link to another resource, such as a web
        page, a stylesheet, or an anchor within the same page. 
        <p></p>
        <strong>Usage: </strong>It tells the browser where to navigate or what resource to link to, without embedding it directly in the
            current document.
